This is a flutter project with python for machine learning.



## Getting Started

Open the folder in any IDE and run 'flutter run --no-sound-null-safety' in terminal.
Then Go to Violence Detection folder and run main.py.

You must install all the requred libraries before running.
Some major changes are needed in the project for the gender based violence detection. It works great on simple violence detection.
